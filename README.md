# DustCloud.Social
## (name defo pending)
Federated Social Media App designed to run through the Solid protocol. Aim to deliver similar user satisfaction to features of Mastodon, Discord and Lemmy.ml through a federated model.

Plan to use largely TypeScript with Electron.
But, I have very little web dev experience. So, design experience + suggestions = welcome
